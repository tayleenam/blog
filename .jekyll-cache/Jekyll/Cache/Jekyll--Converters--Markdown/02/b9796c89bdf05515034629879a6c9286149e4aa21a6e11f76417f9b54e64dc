I"œ<p>Hey! Iâ€™m Taylee. ðŸ‘‹</p>

<p>I have an MFA in fiction and small dog named Leo and, now, this blog.</p>

<p>Blogs are self-indulgent. We all know that. Oooh, look at me and all the things I have to say to the waiting world! Ooh, look at me! Blogs are so stupid. Blogs are so 2007.</p>

<p>Welcome to my blog.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m political, but arenâ€™t we all?</p>

<p>And, sometimes, I write.</p>

<p>Taylee</p>
