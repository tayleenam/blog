I"‚<p>A lot of times, I feel like a can of silly string with no exact cours, no precise action, no idea what Iâ€™m doing except to occupy the space in front of me.</p>

<p>Hi, Iâ€™m here. Iâ€™m Taylee Nam and Iâ€™m on this call, just taking notes.</p>

<p><em>The silly nature of the string has nothing to do with my own personality although I have been told that I can be, on occasion, silly.</em></p>

<p>People are collections of stories. Stories who make them who they are (or at least who they think they are. Who people <em>really</em> are can only be determined in the smallest hours of the night or when there is an indeterminant amount of free stuff offered somewhere to the  also indeterminant, but proportionate number of people who get there first.</p>

<p>Tell me your story.</p>

<p>On an unrelated note, have you ever noticed how the world looks at 4:00pm on any given weekend-day?</p>
