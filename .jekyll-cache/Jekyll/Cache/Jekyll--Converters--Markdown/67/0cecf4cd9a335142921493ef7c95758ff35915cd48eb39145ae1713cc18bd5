I"ä<p>Iâ€™m taking notes.</p>

<p>A lot of times, I feel like a can of silly string with no exact course except for the space in front of me. Bam. Gotcha. The silly nature of the string has nothing to do with my own personality although I have been told that I can be, on occasion, silly.</p>

<p>Time is a physical construct. It exists in our physical world and we are subject to it.</p>

<p>I think that if you could exist outside of time, you win.</p>

<p>Win, like, everything.</p>

<p>We should figure that out, sometime.</p>

<p>Social media is cute, because it allows us to showcase all our best qualities, hide all our worst and pretend like our middles donâ€™t exist.</p>

<p>Leo got his manhood removed on Thursday and he is still in a mood about it. He has refused to talk to me more than bark commands. Water! Food! Outside! I indulge him, because Iâ€™m an indulgent parent. I donâ€™t feel bad about removing his balls. The last thing we need in this house is an unplanned pregnancy.</p>

<p>On an unrelated note, I changed birth control methods recently. My current one was not, shall we say, satisfactory for all parties.</p>

<p>On a further unrelated note, have you ever noticed how the world looks at 4:00pm on any given weekend-day?</p>
