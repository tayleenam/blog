I"9<p>A lot of times, I feel like a can of silly string with no exact cours, no precise action, no idea what I’m doing except to occupy the space in front of me.</p>

<p>Hi, I’m here. I’m Taylee Nam and I’m on this call, just taking notes.</p>

<p><em>The silly nature of the string has nothing to do with my own personality although I have been told that I can be, on occasion, silly.</em></p>

<p>People, to me, are collections of stories.</p>

<p>Take my guy, for example. He’s my boyfriend, but I think the word boyfriend is stupid and childish and my guy is neither stupid nor childish, so.</p>

<p>So take my guy.</p>

<p>Time is a physical construct. It exists in our physical world and we are subject to it.</p>

<p>I think that if you could exist outside of time, you win.</p>

<p>Win, like, everything.</p>

<p>We should figure that out, sometime.</p>

<p>Social media is cute, because it allows us to showcase all our best qualities, hide all our worst and pretend like our middles don’t exist.</p>

<p>Leo got his manhood removed on Thursday and he is still in a mood about it. He has refused to talk to me more than bark commands. Water! Food! Outside! I indulge him, because I’m an indulgent parent. I don’t feel bad about removing his balls. The last thing we need in this house is an unplanned pregnancy.</p>

<p>On an unrelated note, I changed birth control methods recently. My current one was not, shall we say, satisfactory for all parties.</p>

<p>On a further unrelated note, have you ever noticed how the world looks at 4:00pm on any given weekend-day?</p>
