I"\<p>A lot of times, I feel like a can of silly string with no exact cours, no precise action, no idea what I’m doing except to occupy the space in front of me.</p>

<p>Hi, I’m here. I’m Taylee Nam and I’m on this call, just taking notes.</p>

<p><em>The silly nature of the string has nothing to do with my own personality although I have been told that I can be, on occasion, silly.</em></p>

<p>People, to me, are collections of stories.</p>

<p>Tell me your story. I’ll be taking</p>

<p>On an unrelated note, have you ever noticed how the world looks at 4:00pm on any given weekend-day?</p>
