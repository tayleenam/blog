<p><br />
<br />
<br />
I have an MFA in fiction and small dog named Leo and, now, this blog.</p>

<p>I like pink wine and sad music. I think sunsets are overrated. But I really like twilight.</p>

<p>I like the outdoors, but I think sometimes being inside and looking out at the outside is better than being actually outside. I’m political, but aren’t we all? I have a lot of opinions. That is the main reason for this blog.</p>

<p>And, sometimes, I write. Enter: <strong>blog</strong>.</p>

<p>Blogs are self-indulgent. We all know that. Oooh, look at me and all the things I have to say to the waiting world! Ooh, look at me! Blogs are so stupid. Blogs are so 2007. 
<br />
<br />
<br />
So anyway. Welcome to my blog.</p>

<p>See you around,</p>
