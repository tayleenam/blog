I"÷<p>Iâ€™m taking notes. Iâ€™m a good little nerd.</p>

<p>Time is a physical construct. It exists in our physical world and we are subject to it.</p>

<p>I think that if you could exist outside of time, you win.</p>

<p>Win, like, everything.</p>

<p>We should figure that out, sometime.</p>

<p>Social media is cute, because it allows us to showcase all our best qualities, hide all our worst and pretend like our middles donâ€™t exist.</p>

<p>Leo got his manhood removed on Thursday and he is still in a mood about it. He has refused to talk to me more than bark commands. Water! Food! Outside! I indulge him, because Iâ€™m an indulgent parent. I donâ€™t feel bad about removing his balls. The last thing we need in this house is an unplanned pregnancy.</p>

<p>On an unrelated note, I changed birth control methods recently. My current one was not, shall we say, satisfactory for all parties.</p>

<p>On a further unrelated note, have you ever noticed how the world looks at 4:00pm on any given weekend-day?</p>
