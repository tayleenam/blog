Define your terms. If you are going to argue anything, you must define your terms.
<br />
<br />
<br />
For example, if I were to try and convince Leo that he is better off not barking at me in order to get my attention, I say: 

“To bark is to express oneself in an annoying and harsh manner. You may not bark at me. End of discussion. Go to your room. You’re grounded.” 

Leo, because he is a dog and does not understand the concept of being grounded nor arguments nor even what b-a-r-k-i-n-g means, would most likely ignore me and go on yapping.

Regardless of Leo’s current state of physical existence (and I say current, because I absolutely believe that all dogs go to heaven), the point I’m trying to make is that defining your terms orients you and everyone else within an argument. 
<br />
<br />
<br />
Another example: time.

What is time? Depends on your definition, cc: [Sean Carroll](https://www.wired.com/2010/02/what-is-time/), [Carlo Rovelli](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04558-7) and [Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/what-is-time-a-history-of-physics-biology-clocks-and-culture-20200504/) and yes, I did read** those articles. 

Here’s how I can best understand time: 
<br />
<br />
Time is above and around us; we are subject to it, because we choose to be.

Time is flying.

Time is an illusion.

Time is totally not an illusion, because time is how I know I’ve been scrolling through r/oddlysatisfying for an hour and a half. 
<br />
<br />
And I just think, I don’t know, I just think that if you could exist outside of time, you win. 
<br />
<br />
Win, like, everything.
<br />
<br />
We should figure that out, sometime.
<br />
<br />
