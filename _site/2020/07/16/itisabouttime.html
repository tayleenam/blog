  <div class="post-body">
    <p>Define your terms. If you are going to argue anything, you must define your terms.</p>

<p>For example, if I were to try and convince Leo that he is better off not barking at me in order to get my attention, I say:</p>

<p>“To bark is to express oneself in an annoying and harsh manner. You may not bark at me. End of discussion. Go to your room. You’re grounded.”</p>

<p>Leo, because he is a dog and does not understand the concept of being grounded nor arguments nor even what b-a-r-k-i-n-g means, would most likely ignore me and go on yapping.</p>

<p>Regardless of Leo’s current state of physical existence (and I say current, because I absolutely believe that all dogs go to heaven), the point I’m trying to make is that defining your terms orients you and everyone else within an argument.</p>

<p>Another example: time.</p>

<p>What is time? Depends on your definition, cc: <a href="https://www.wired.com/2010/02/what-is-time/">Sean Carroll</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04558-7">Carlo Rovelli</a> and <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/what-is-time-a-history-of-physics-biology-clocks-and-culture-20200504/">Quanta Magazine</a> and yes, I did read** those articles.</p>

<p>Here’s how I can best understand time:</p>

<p>Time is above and around us; we are subject to it, because we choose to be.</p>

<p>Time is flying.</p>

<p>Time is an illusion.</p>

<p>Time is totally <em>not</em> an illusion, because time is how I know I’ve been scrolling through r/oddlysatisfying for an hour and a half.</p>

<p>And I just think. I don’t know. I guess, I just think, that if you could exist outside of time, then you win.</p>

<p>Win, like, everything.</p>

<p>We should figure that out, sometime.</p>
