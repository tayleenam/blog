    <p>Most people are doing their best. Trying, anyway. I like to think so.</p>

<p>Most people are washing and chopping and dressing their vegetables, because most people want to be healthier.</p>

<p>Most people are downloading meditation apps to address their childhood wounds.</p>

<p>Most people try to experience the life-changing magic of tidying up. They throw out clothing and birthday cards and half-used hand creams.</p>

<p>Most people have access to a recycling can, because most people want to protect the coral reef’s from soda bottles and plastic bags.</p>

<p>Most people are thinking about donating to the American Cancer Society or an art museum or a political campaign or a local restaurant’s GoFundMe. Most people want to give back.</p>

<p>Most people aren’t sleeping well at night, because most people care enough about their careers, families, friends–name any structure in society and most likely, you care about it. Or pretend to care, and even that pretense (caring/not caring) will keep you up at night. Are you a fraud? Maybe. Are you worthy of love? Maybe not if you’re a fraud. And etc.</p>

<p>Most people are attempting to live, laugh, love.</p>

<p>Life is hard, but we have great intentions and we try our best.</p>

<p>Do or do not, there is no try.</p>

<p>Shut up, Yoda, sir.</p>
