<h2 id="hey-im-taylee">Hey! I’m Taylee.</h2>
<p><br />
<br />
<br />
I have an MFA in fiction and small dog named Leo and, now, this blog.</p>

<p>I like pink wine and sad music. I run a bit, but only for the race participation medals. I read. Mostly young adult fiction, short stories about war, autobiographies by female comedians. I’m political, but aren’t we all? I have a lot of opinions.</p>

<p>And, sometimes, I write. Enter: <strong>blog</strong>.</p>

<p>Blogs are self-indulgent. We all know that. Oooh, look at me and all the things I have to say to the waiting world! Ooh, look at me! Blogs are so stupid. Blogs are so 2007. 
<br />
<br />
<br />
So anyway. Welcome to my blog.</p>

<p>See you around,</p>
