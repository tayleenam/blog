Hey! I'm Taylee.
-----------------
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have an MFA in fiction and small dog named Leo and, now, this blog.

I like pink wine and sad music. I run a bit, but only for the race participation medals. I read. Mostly young adult fiction, short stories about war, autobiographies by female comedians. I'm political, but aren't we all? I have a lot of opinions. 

And, sometimes, I write. Enter: **blog**.

Blogs are self-indulgent. We all know that. Oooh, look at me and all the things I have to say to the waiting world! Ooh, look at me! Blogs are so stupid. Blogs are so 2007. 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So anyway. Welcome to my blog.

See you around,

**Taylee**
